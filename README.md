# OS_Multithreaded_Server

This is my project for my third year module operating systems.
It is a multi threaded tcp bank system written in java so far the project can:
  - add users
  - authenticate users
  - edit account details
  - withdraw from the account
  - deposit to the account
   
  Overall the project is buggy but it should work.

### How to use it
When running on the console of an ide the user should,
  - run the server project on one instance of an ide and the client on another
  - in the client chose an option from the menu
  - continue to follow the onscreen instructions
